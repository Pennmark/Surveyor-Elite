PLATFORM INSTALLATION HINTS:

CodeIngniter 2 & bare Platform Structures:

I installed in an "assets" folder outside the system and application folder. This was for security so Surveyor Elite files were far from any system files.  Place inset div in the "view" you wish, using the "model" to place the scripts in the head on the correct pages.  You can also have the script link in the head at all times loading with all pages, as long as the activation "div" is only on desired pages.

Drupal 7: 

Because of Drupal CMS, you must install in one of Durpal's designated areas.

Install in "/misc" folder. Use the "drupal_add_js()" to add the scripts to the head. Include JQuery library if not already included.

Add the "survey_content" div to the template in which you wish it to appear (content, sidebar, footer, etc...).  If no survey, a 1em high icon will appear, and nothing else.  This is just a marker to let site know the div is present and working.  If a survey has been created, it will appear here.
