PLATFORM INSTALLATION HINTS:

CodeIngniter 2 & bare Platform Structures:

I installed in an "assets" folder outside the system and application folder. This was for security so Surveyor Elite files were far from any system files.  Place inset div in the "view" you wish, using the "model" to place the scripts in the head on the correct pages.  You can also have the script link in the head at all times loading with all pages, as long as the activation "div" is only on desired pages.

Drupal 7: 

Because of Drupal CMS, you must install in one of Durpal's designated areas.

Install in "sites/all/modules". Use the "drupal_add_js()" to add the scripts to the head.  I used page detection in the page.tpl.php to create the insert div in the content are when the correct node is detected, but this can be achieved any number of ways.  You need not connect this like other Durpal Modules. Surveyor Elite will execute itselt and does not require Drupal's assistance.
